	  I’m a London born artist working with programming code, realtime media & audio. Through live coding in front of an audience I’ve worked in other performance fields such as dance, theatre, music & cinematography. My experience of disability strongly impacts my practice. Living with pain, physical limitations, disillusionment and disconnection from society affect my thought process and how I create, using my disability and its limitations as part of my process. I see sound visually and work with this to create narrative driven explorations of glitchy ambient electronic soundscapes, full of tensions between control and chaos, denatured organic samples, playful layers of meaning, influences of early video games and cinematic scores. Performance is a key part of my practice as it fulfils a need to be seen physically and creatively, but in a form I control. </p>

	  <p>
	  I’m interested in programming as a performance art and the misuse, deconstruction, repurposing and breaking of software to challenge ownership, narrative and visibility. Programming as a means of facilitating and augmenting human communication rather than replacing it. Facilitating new forms of expression that put humans at the centre of control.
  </p>

	<p>
	  The programming code I create is often visually present in my work and I publish my source-code. The self-expression and power it gives is too important to me physically and emotionally to remain hidden. Through sharing I am part of a community of artists growing together and opening the world of programming.
